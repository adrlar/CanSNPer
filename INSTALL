#Installing CanSNPer
###################
CanSNPer is written in Python and requires Python installed as well as several 
dependencies listed below. The software is developed and tested with Python 
version 2.7 but earlier (2.5, 2.6) may work just as well. Due to other 
dependencies other versions of Python are not supported.

When the dependencies are all installed CanSNPer can be run as it is from the 
shell. To be able to easily access it in the future, place CanSNPer and the 
CanSNPer.conf configuration file in a directory in your PATH.

To begin with, try:

$ ./CanSNPer --help

If there are no errors and you see the help text printed, CanSNPer is working 
correctly and you can go on to do your analysis.

More on how to run CanSNPer in its various modes can be found in the README 
file that came with the distribution.

CanSNPer has only been tested on Linux, but feel free to tinker with setting up 
a working version on your favorite OS. Mauve is available on other platforms.
